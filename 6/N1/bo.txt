To copy content from your local machine to your cloud vm, use the following command:

scp -i <pravate_key_file.pem> <content_to_copy> username@public_ip:location

For example:
To copy a file:

scp -i ./private_key.pem online.zip artushar@20.30.40.50:/home/artushar/Downloads

To copy a folder:

scp -r -i ./private_key.pem cse406 artushar@20.30.40.50:/home/artushar/Downloads



Note: You cannot directly copy the contents to the seed user. So later you need to move the content from /home/artushar/Downloads to /home/seed/Downloads or wherever you want to.



To connect cloud vm  using ssh:

ssh -i <private_file.pem> username@public_ip



To connect cloud VM using vnc client:


At first, you need to move to the seed user. Then run the vnc server from the cloud VM. 

sudo su seed

vncserver -localhost no

The first time, it will prompt you to set up a password. Later you need to use the password to connect from the vncclient.

The first vncserver is set up at port 5901, and the second 5902,...

So to connect the vm cloud from vncclient, you must give the accurate port number.
Download the vnc viewer from here https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/files/stable/1.13.1/

For example 20.30.40.50:5901 and provide the password
